The Mocca Programming Language
==============================

Actually to early for a precise description, but try it nonetheless:

* int, boolean and function data types
* expression evaluation respective correct precedence and associativity
* variable definitions and usage in expressions
* lexical scoping
* functions behave like closures
* a function call returns the last statement per default
* a few semantic runtime checks

No flow control structures atm. 

See index.html for a few code samples. Basically itÂ´s quite easy to get started: include mocca-lang.js and type your code in text/mocca script blocks.
